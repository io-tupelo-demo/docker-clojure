= Clojure Docker Template Project

A simple template for Clojure projects to run in Docker

== Overview

This Clojure project shows my favorite layout of for both source & test files
(sample Java source is included as well).  The project is also set-up to use the
https://github.com/cloojure/tupelo[Tupelo Clojure] library and the
https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh[lein-test-refresh] plugin.

It also includes a `Dockerfile` to package the uberjar in a Docker image.  The following short
scripts show how to build the Docker image, run it as a Docker container, and then delete the
container:

- build.bash
- run.bash
- clean.bash


== How to User This Project

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, and `git`.

=== Clone the Project Using Git

Verify you have Git installed:

```bash
> git --version
git version 2.25.0
```

Use `git` to clone the project (via SSH) into a new project names `demo`:
```bash
> git clone  git@github.com:io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git ssh URL
```

or, clone via HTTPS (if you don't have SSH set up on your computer & GitHub):
```bash
> git clone  https://github.com/io-tupelo/clj-template.git  demo  # git https URL
```

Then `cd` (change directory) into the new project:

```bash
> cd demo
```

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

=== Verify you have Docker installed

For Mac OSX, it is easiest to install the Docker Desktop app.  
For Linux, I just install Docker natively.  See http://docker.com

Verify your installation is working:
```bash
> docker --version
Docker version 20.10.14, build a224086
```

== Running the code via Docker

First, build a Uberjar from the command line and include it into a Docker image:

```
~/io-tupelo-demo/docker-clojure > ./build.bash 

lein clean
lein uberjar
Compiling demo.core
Created /home/alan/io-tupelo-demo/docker-clojure/target/uberjar/demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Created /home/alan/io-tupelo-demo/docker-clojure/target/uberjar/demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

# build the Docker image `demo-clj-image` for our Clojure app
docker build . --tag demo-clj-image

Step 3/5 : COPY  target/uberjar/demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar  /app/demo.jar

Removing intermediate container bd8dd45f86a6
 ---> c1a79f6f12b6
Successfully built c1a79f6f12b6
Successfully tagged demo-clj-image:latest
```

Next, use Docker to run the image in a container:

```
~/io-tupelo-demo/docker-clojure > ./run.bash 

# run the Docker image `demo-clj-image` with the name `demo-clj-container`
docker run  --name demo-clj-container  demo-clj-image
Hello, World! Again!
```

Cleanup the container when finished:

```
~/io-tupelo-demo/docker-clojure > ./clean.bash 

# terminate and delete the running container
docker rm --force demo-clj-container
demo-clj-container
# remove the docker image
docker image rm --force demo-clj-image

```

== Running Unit Tests - Plain (non-Docker)

From the command line type:

```pre
> lein clean
> lein test
```

with result:

```pre
lein test _bootstrap
-------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.1    Java 13
-------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core
result => "Hello, World!\n"

Ran 4 tests containing 6 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

I do the above so often that I have a Bash/Zsh alias set up:

```pre
alias lct="time (lein do clean, test)"       # lct => Lein Clean Test
```
